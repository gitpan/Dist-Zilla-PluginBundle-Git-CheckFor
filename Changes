Revision history for Dist-Zilla-PluginBundle-Git-CheckFor

0.005     2012-10-03 22:10:53 PST8PDT
	* make our test suite usable on !unix platforms (github #4, #5)
	* Fix breakage introduced by the git NextVersion plugin in  1.122770 by
	  pulling over the removed code and integrating it here.  This is expected
	  to be a temporary measure as we figure out a more permanent (and
	  hopefully cooperative) solution.

0.004     2012-05-04 14:53:44 America/Los_Angeles
	* [Git::CheckFor::CorrectBranch] now permits releases from multiple brnaches
	  (Karen Etheridge)

0.003     2012-05-02 11:11:39 America/Los_Angeles
	* handle version tags where '-TRIAL' is appeneded.  We'll need to revisit this
	  later to make things Work Better, but for now it works and with a minimum of
	  fuss.

0.002     2012-04-13 14:16:08 America/Los_Angeles
	* no functional changes!
	* bump Test::Moose::More prereq to 0.008, as we need a version of
	  has_attribute_ok that handles checking roles w/o barfing (as Test::Moose now
	  seems to)
