Revision history for Dist-Zilla-PluginBundle-Git-CheckFor

0.011     2014-04-11 12:57:35 PDT-0700
	* Set GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL, etc, in our tests to prevent git identity crises;
	  closes #13
	* Rework a commit message in t/plugin/fixups.t; this closes #16 (or
	  should, at any rate)

0.010     2014-04-11 11:48:23 PDT-0700
    * use CheckForBin, not RequiresExternal in our dzil config; this should
	  stop false fails from being reported (and be nicer in general) when git
	  is not installed on some system

0.009     2014-01-28 15:50:28 PST-0800
    * merge github #11, github #15

0.008     2013-11-10 22:55:17 PST-0800
    * fix issue with parsing utf8-encoded files

0.007     2013-09-29 17:04:08 PDT-0700
	* Fix issues with travis and our test suite (aka set user.name, user.email
	  in our test repositories)

0.006     2012-11-14 22:14:15 PST8PDT
	* Add plugin to check for common merge mishaps [Mike Doherty]
	* Add explicit dependency on the git executable

0.005     2012-10-03 22:10:53 PST8PDT
	* make our test suite usable on !unix platforms (github #4, #5)
	* Fix breakage introduced by the git NextVersion plugin in  1.122770 by
	  pulling over the removed code and integrating it here.  This is expected
	  to be a temporary measure as we figure out a more permanent (and
	  hopefully cooperative) solution.

0.004     2012-05-04 14:53:44 America/Los_Angeles
	* [Git::CheckFor::CorrectBranch] now permits releases from multiple brnaches
	  (Karen Etheridge)

0.003     2012-05-02 11:11:39 America/Los_Angeles
	* handle version tags where '-TRIAL' is appeneded.  We'll need to revisit this
	  later to make things Work Better, but for now it works and with a minimum of
	  fuss.

0.002     2012-04-13 14:16:08 America/Los_Angeles
	* no functional changes!
	* bump Test::Moose::More prereq to 0.008, as we need a version of
	  has_attribute_ok that handles checking roles w/o barfing (as Test::Moose now
	  seems to)

0.001     2012-02-06 13:11:50 America/Los_Angeles
