=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Git::CheckFor::CorrectBranch - Check that you're on the correct branch before release

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.008 of Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Git::CheckFor::CorrectBranch - released November 10, 2013 as part of Dist-Zilla-PluginBundle-Git-CheckFor.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    ; in dist.ini
    [Git::CheckFor::CorrectBranch]
    ; release_branch defaults to 'master'
    release_branch = master
    release_branch = stable

    # on branch topic/geewhiz...
    $ dzil release # ABENDs!

    # ...and on branch master
    $ dzil release # succeeds

    # ...and on branch stable
    $ dzil release # succeeds

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a simple L<Dist::Zilla> plugin to check that you are on the correct
branch before allowing a release...  Its reason for existance is to prevent
accidental releases being cut from topic branches: which are in general not
unrecoverable, but annoying, messy, and (sometimes) embarrassing.

=head1 OPTIONS

=head2 release_branch

This is the name of the branch it is legal to release from: it defaults to
'master'. Multiple branches may be specified; you may want to allow 'master'
and 'stable'.
